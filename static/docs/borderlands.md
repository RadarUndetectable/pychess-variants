1.	Win by Surrender: Capture both enemy Chiefs and the enemy immediately surrenders.
2.	Win by Conquest: Occupy all four Village Squares for two consecutive moves (one move by each player).

## Drawing Conditions
1.	No Progress: 150 moves (75 by each player) without a capture or promotion.
2.	Impasse: the game is unable to progress due to neither side having a realistic chance of occupying all four Village Squares or capturing both enemy Chiefs.

## Losing Conditions
1.	No Legal Moves: if a player cannot make a legal move they lose the game.
2.	Perpetual Check: (TODO: confirm this works for Chiefs).
3.	Move Repetiion: repeating a position for the 5th time.

## Promotion
With the exception of the Chief and Guard (which are non-promoting pieces), pieces mandatorily promote upon reaching the Promotion Zone:
