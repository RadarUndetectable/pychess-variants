Here's my current submission, it's a classic Xianqgi vs Chess army impossible to balance task. I'm also supplying the graphics for the pieces so it looks cool lol. I'm not sure if I'm gonna make any more changes.

Story: the Red Army assassinated the White Queen. White has come back for revenge but the Red Army was expecting them and the assassin is still hiding.

Notable change:

    White starts. Red wins on any draws. Fifty-move rule is now 25.
    Red Soldiers have double move, they can move sideways on the 5th range or below (but then lose the double move). If any soldier reaches the last rank, Red also wins.
    White cannot enter Red's palace.
    White can summon the ghost of the White Queen anywhere on its field (4 lower ranks). The ghost is a Queen piece that cannot take.
    Red has a single Soldier it can drop anywhere on its field (4 top ranks).
