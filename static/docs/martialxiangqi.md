# martialXiangqi

NEW ITERATION, HERE'S THE CHANGES!
- Reworked starting setup, now using Xiangqi pieces and the way the pieces are set up are shaped like two people in a martial arts match. (Hence, Martial Arts Xiangqi)
- Removed Shogi Promotions. (Since this isn't a Shogi variant no more)
- Drops are now limited to the first two ranks (Indicated by the Rivers, I didn't entirely remove them due to the sparse nature of the pieces.)
- Added perpetual chasing rules. (From axf)
- Stalemates now result in a loss.


All pieces are identical to their Xiangqi counterparts, with the following changes:
- Generals: Moves 1 space in any direction, but are still confined to the Ring. They're basically a fusion of the Xiangqi General and Advisor. Oh and they can face eachother too.
- Horse: Standard Xiangqi Horse.
- Cannon: Standard Xiangqi Cannon.
- Archer/Catapult: Diagonal Variant of the Cannon
- Elephant: Slides two steps in any diagonal direction and is not restricted by the River. It's possible that this piece will be restricted to only the squares it can move at the start when dropping it, those being the bottom corners or bottom middle.
- Chariot: Standard Xiangqi Chariot.
- Bishop: Diagonal Variant of the Chariot.
