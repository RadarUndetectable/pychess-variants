# OD_variant

My submission, Calling the variant "Breakthrough" for now. (Or Offensive Defensive idk lol)
It's an asymmetric variant with different armies on a 9x9 board. White's army consists of more familiar pieces and movement where as black's army consists of leapers.

White's army includes: Pawn, Rook, Xiangqi Horse, Bishop, Chancellor, Archbishop and the King.
Black's army include: Quadrapawn, Centaur (Knight + Mann), Alibaba which can move one back, Okapi, Gold General + forwards like a Dabbaba which can also capture diagonally back and forwards like a knight (Probably the most convoluted piece in the variant to describe. I'll call this piece the Gold Defender) and Kirin (The royal piece of this army).

Both white and black have different primary goals.
White wants to checkmate black, while black wants to win by capture the flag or king of the hill (home rank of white).

However Black's mobility of pieces (not quadrapawns) is restricted to only their half of the board and the central rank (5 6 7 8 9) and the home ranks of white (1 and 2). While White's pieces have no restrictions on their mobility.

Black's royal piece however can promote into a piece gaining the ability to move without mobility restriction and also gaining a extra backwards movement needing to demote back to win by flag. Whereas White's royal piece is restricted to a palace of sorts of radius 1 (kinda a semicircle).

The promotion region for black are the 3rd 4th and 5th ranks and for white it's the 9th rank.
Both sides pawn/pawn equivalents can promote to any piece in their army except the royal piece.

Black also has the ability to drop 5 quadrapawns in their half of the board. (this count could be lowered to like 3 or 4 if I had just found a way for initial double move for quadrapawns).

The person who get's stalemated wins (It's going to be pretty rare as draw by 50 move rule is more likely)
