concept: kingdom (chess army) vs robots
will try to keep this message updated
rules insofar as they differ from normal chess:

    kingdom goes first
    most robot pieces are "roboticized" versions of a chess or fairy chess piece
    roboticization adds grasshopper abilities to a piece in the same directions that it normally goes, with range increased +1 on the grasshopper moves, e.g. a roboticized rook would gain rookhopper abilities and a roboticized ferz would gain the ability to hop over a piece diagonally adjacent to it to the square immediately behind
    missile is a roboticized rook
    drone is a roboticized bishop
    turret is a roboticized pawn
    core is a roboticized king (can't castle)
    automaton is a roboticized berolina pawn
    rover is a little bit different, it moves and captures as a ferz or as a xiangqi horse
    turrets and automata cant double step and therefore cant be captured en passant
    turrets can capture pawns en passant
    cores are the royal pieces of the robots and there are 2 of them,  it is illegal for the robots to allow EITHER one to be captured, e.g. if they are forked that's checkmate unless the forking piece is captured
    if a robot piece on the left side of the board touches a robot piece on the right side of the board, the robots lose (even if the robots checkmate the kingdom while doing this, the robots still lose) THIS IS THE RULE THAT CONCERNS REGIONS OF THE BOARD
    turrets and automata promote to rover, droid, or missile on rank 1

starting position:

    kingdom: same as normal chess
    robots: drones a8 h8, cores b8 g8, missiles a7 h7, rovers b7 g7, automata c7 f7 c8 f8, turrets a6 b6 c6 f6 g6 h6
